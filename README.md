# Electromechanical-Systems-Design-Wireless-Phone-Charging-Table

- Prototyped, designed and tested a wireless charging table that could charge a phone or a wireless charging compatible device placed at any position or orientation on the surface
- Utilized Computer Vision to detect the placement of a device from under the table with a translucent surface, and a gantry system to move the wireless charger to the appropriate position
- For Computer Vision, I specifically worked on camera fisheye lens calibration using OpenCV
